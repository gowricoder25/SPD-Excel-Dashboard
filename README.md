##About Dataset
The Student Performance Dataset is designed to evaluate and predict student outcomes based on various factors that can influence academic success. This synthetic dataset includes features that are commonly considered in educational research and real-world scenarios, such as attendance, study habits, previous academic performance, and participation in extracurricular activities. The goal is to understand how these factors correlate with the final grades of students and to build a predictive model that can forecast student performance.
